          “A new philosophy of the future is needed. I believe it should be
          curiosity about the Universe — expand humanity to become a
          multiplanet, then interstellar, species to see what’s out there.”
          (Elon Musk on Twitter, 27 July 2022)
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Starting from the very beginning of the war, Elon Musk has been one of
          the greatest supporters of Ukraine. The billionaire whose personality
          has gone far beyond Silicon Valley and auto industry circles was one
          of the first multinational CEOs to publicly show his support for
          Ukraine, defying traditions that companies remain neutral on political
          issues. In doing so, Musk not only helped Ukraine to survive the most
          horrible first weeks of invasion, but also inspired other CEOs by own
          example.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Elon Musk: “It is surprising to see that in this day and age. I
          thought we had sort of moved beyond such things for the most part. It
          is concerning. If you can get away with it, then this will be a
          message to other countries that perhaps they could get away with it
          too.”
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          On February 26, Musk reacted swiftly and decisively to Ukraine’s
          Digital Minister Mykhailo Fedorov’s request in Twitter to provide
          Starlink-powered Internet access. In a couple of months he explained
          that it was not really a surprise because he had prepared very early
          to help:
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          “We did think that Starlink might be needed, and we took some
          preemptive actions to ensure that it could be provided quickly. When
          the request came, we acted very rapidly. It is worth noting that the
          satellite internet connectivity of Ukraine was taken offline by a
          cyberattack on the day of the invasion permanently. The cell towers
          are either being blown up or they are being jammed. There is a major
          fiber backbone which the russians are aware of. It was quite likely
          that they will sever that fiber link. This would leave Ukraine with
          very few connections open. So Starlink might be, certainly in some
          parts of Ukraine, the only connection.”
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          In the following three months the company Space X delivered to Ukraine
          15,000 Starlink kits. Very soon this satellite communication system
          has become crucial part of Ukraine’s war strategy, as its capabilities
          were put to the test on a daily basis by Ukrainian soldiers. The
          satellite dish has been used to plan missions and fight misinformation
          from russia, as well as keep soldiers in touch with their families
          through encrypted satellite messages and provide a source of leisure
          activity. Ukrainian drones were relying on Starlink to drop bombs on
          russian forward positions. Besieged Ukrainian troops in the Azovstal
          steelworks plant in Mariupol were only able to communicate with the
          outer world because they had a Starlink device. In April, Starlink was
          used as a temporary solution to quickly restore the internet in the
          liberated areas of Kyiv Oblast, after russian troops made a “goodwill
          gesture” from there.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Musk was convinced from the start that putin clearly had plans to
          annex part of Ukraine: “My best guess was that he would seek to
          capture the Eastern third of the country. Frankly, if you just
          listened to the rhetoric, then it is clear that he was going after at
          least portions of Ukraine that have a significant percentage of
          russian speakers. He did that already in Georgia.”
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Eventually, the entrepreneur went so far as to propose putin a duel,
          in an attempt to end the war. This proposal had earned him threats on
          his life from the russian president’s loyalists. putin himself
          pretended he didn’t know about the offer, as he was too scared to
          respond. On the contrary, confident and fearless Musk who has at the
          moment more than 105.3 million followers on Twitter and successfully
          runs several companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink)
          promises to visit Ukraine as soon as the war is over.

          “Very effective, very effective. It helped us a lot, in many moments
          related to the blockade of our cities, towns, and related to the
          occupied territories. Sometimes we completely lost communication with
          those places. To lose contact with those people is to lose control
          completely, to lose reality. Believe me: People who got out of the
          occupied cities, where there was no such assistance as Starlink, said
          that the russians told them that Ukraine doesn’t exist anymore, and
          some people even began to believe it. I am really grateful for the
          support of Starlink.” (Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine,
          interview with Wired, 02 June 2022)

    DescriptionEnglish: (
      <span className="flex flex-col gap-24px">
        <span className="font-rlight">
          “To say that people of a country must support their own government is
          not patriotism, but actually a form of slavery. True patriotism
          sometimes entails fighting against the evil coming out of your own
          country. That is the way to help your own country become a more
          beautiful place.” (Vitalik Buterin on Twitter, 9 March 2022)
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          The Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is known for expressing his
          opinions publicly. 28-year-old Buterin, who was born in Russia but
          moved to Canada at the age of six, never behaved like the majority of
          his ex-country-mates. Moreover, his status in contemporary IT world
          allows him to speak directly and sometimes very inconveniently for
          “bad guys”. So, it wasn’t a big surprise when the entrepreneur hit out
          at putin almost immediately after announcement of the “military
          operation”.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Vitalik Buterin: “Very upset by putin’s decision to abandon the
          possibility of a peaceful solution to the dispute with Ukraine and go
          to war instead. This is a crime against the Ukrainian and Russian
          people. I want to wish everyone security, although I know that there
          will be no security. Glory to Ukraine.” (on Twitter, 24 February 2022)
          In the following tweet one minute later Buterin directly expressed his
          support to Ukraine: “Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.”
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Consequently, the majority of influencers on Twitter supported
          Buterin. However, there were those who acted oppositely. For example,
          one Chinese user asked Vitalik: “Aren’t you Russian? You are a
          traitor. Did you have a bad experience with putin?” Buterin did not
          miss the chance to make a comeback. In his response written in
          Mandarin Buterin stressed that obligatory support of one’s government
          is not a patriotism, but only a form of slavery.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Buterin has been vocal in his opposition to the slightest possibility
          of war, tweeting earlier in February: “An attack on Ukraine can only
          harm Russia, Ukraine and humanity. Whether the situation will return
          to a peaceful path or there will be a war can now be decided not by
          Zelensky, not by NATO, but by @KremlinRussia. I hope they choose
          wisely”.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          But they didn’t. Thus, Vitalik Buterin had no other choice except for
          helping Ukraine ‒ by the means of Ethereum. Since the start of
          invasion, cryptocurrency has proven a practical method. Crypto
          donations have demonstrated the ability to provide instant,
          cross-border money transfers that do not require mediation from
          conventional financial institutions. Within Ukraine, activists and
          volunteer groups have been using cryptocurrency to crowdsource
          donations as the country’s financial system has become heavily
          strained.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          On 6 April 2022, the Ukrainian funds revealed the information
          concerning impressive amounts of secret donations. In the largest of
          them, Vitalik Buterin has contributed a total of $5 million in crypto,
          or 1500 Ethereum (ETH). Half of the this amount went directly to Aid
          for Ukraine, a joint initiative of the Ukrainian government, FTX,
          Everstake and Kuna for crypto donations, while the other half went to
          Unchain Fund, a cryptocurrency charity initiative created by activists
          in the blockchain community. Buterin did not make an official public
          announcement regarding the transaction. It was only revealed only
          through his registered Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain name,
          “vitalik.eth”, which served as the origin of the transfer.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rnarrow">
          Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine,
          publicly thanked Buterin’s contribution in a tweet: “I couldn’t be
          more grateful for every crypto donation to our lifesaving initiative,
          Aid for Ukraine. It really helps to strengthen our country and protect
          its democratic values. Special thanks to Vitalik Buterin for standing
          with Ukraine.”
        </span>
        <span className="font-rlight">
          For Vitalik Buterin, joining the Kyiv Tech Summit (6-9 September 2022)
          just in a couple of days before the highly-anticipated Ethereum Merge
          signified a practical way to provide support to hackers on the ground
          floor building the humanitarian tools of tomorrow.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rlight">
          The event hosted by the UNIT.City brought together 30 tech experts and
          500 developers who submitted over 50 projects as part of the
          crypto-related three-day hackathon. Discussions were held on topics
          like decentralized electoral voting, central banks issuing digital
          currencies, and the role of Web3 and blockchain in preventing
          disinformation. Kyiv Tech Summit was heavily guarded, and Buterin’s
          visit was kept confidential.
        </span>
        <span className="font-rlight">
          At the event, Buterin said he had been closely following the situation
          in Ukraine: “I have been following Ukraine closely since the war
          started. I wanted to come and see for myself and also let Ukraine know
          that lots of people in the blockchain, Ethereum, crypto world really
          care about you guys and lots of people support you”.
