Our native land is defended not only by men, our women are courageously defending it as well.\n\nThe inciting incident for creating this artwork was shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol. I realized I should reflect all the anger I felt that moment. This anger has been felt not only by myself, but by all our people. Everyone who has a heart feels it."',

Moscow propaganda says that this is an operation to liberate Ukrainians, but Ukrainians do not want that. We are independent and a country of great people. Everyone who comes to our land will take a rest in it. Good evening, and Welcome to Free Ukraine!\n\nThe collage poster contains fragments inspired by my favorite artists:\n@Cedric Peyravernay, @Oleksandra Frantseva, @Insist"\n\nEditorial note:\nThis artwork is a gem and a cornerstone of the Avatars for Ukraine collection. Painted by the acclaimed video games artist Stanislav Lunin, it was created in the first week of the war, and became a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance around the world.',

Many animals were maimed. Some died of starvation. They were all scared. Missiles hit some animal shelters...\n\nBut there are people who spare no effort to save animals! To release them from the locked apartments, to find them scared in the streets and release them from under the rubble. Thanks to these people, many animals have been saved. Some of them have found their former families, some of them have found new families, and some of them are still looking for a home. And a lot of animals are kept by volunteers. They need financial support and help.\n\nPlease, do not forget about the people who save animals from the war in Ukraine. Please support Ukrainian volunteers.\nGlory to Ukraine!\nGlory to Ukrainian volunteers!"',
