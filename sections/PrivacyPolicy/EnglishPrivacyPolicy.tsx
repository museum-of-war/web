      concerning you is being processed, and access your stored personal data,

      taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. Please note
      that we may request that you provide some details necessary to verify your
      identity when you request to exercise a legal right regarding your

      with our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other
      associated organizations, our group companies, and affiliates (as
      described below) in order to complete tasks and provide the services to
      you on our behalf. We may share your personal data with: companies that we
      plan to merge with or be acquired by (should such a combination occur, we
      will notify you and will require that the newly combined entity follow
      this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal data); law enforcement,
      government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do
      so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure; or we believe
      in good faith that the disclosure of personal data is necessary to prevent
      physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or
      to investigate violations of any of our policies; our vendors and agents,
      hired by us to provide you with the services; transaction processors (for
      the purpose of ensuring transaction performance and their operation). Our
      Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or
      services of our partner networks, advertisers, transaction processors,
      etc. If you follow a link to any of these websites or services, please
      note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through
      them have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any
      responsibility or liability for these policies or for any information,
      including personal data that may be collected through these websites or
      services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies
      before you submit any information or personal data to these websites or
      use these services. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER Whenever we transfer your
      personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is
      afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
      implemented: the country to which we transfer your personal data has been
      deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the
      European Commission; a specific contract approved by the European
      Commission which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the
      so-called Standard Contractual Clauses. SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA We
      implemented a number of security measures to ensure that your data is not
      lost, abused, or altered, including, but not limited to: firewalls and
      data encryption, physical access controls to our premises, and information
      access authorization controls. We also authorize access to your data only
      for those employees or contractors who require it to fulfill their job or
      service responsibilities. Please note that the transmission of data
      (including communications by email) over the internet or other publicly
      accessible networks is not one hundred percent secure. We shall not be
      responsible for the distribution and use of your personal data that you
      have made visible to other users. DATA RETENTION We consider the amount,
      nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm
      from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
      for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
      purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax,
      accounting, or other requirements when determining the appropriate
      retention period for personal data. The following factors will be
      considered while determining how long we need to retain your personal
      data: if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in
      respect to our relationship with you or if we consider that we need to
      keep information to defend possible future legal claims (e.g. email
      addresses and content, letters will be kept up to 10 years following the
      end of our relationship); to comply with any applicable legal and/or
      regulatory requirements with respect to certain types of personal data; in
      accordance with relevant industry standards or guidelines. We will erase
      your personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds
      applies: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
      purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you
      withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no
      other legal ground for the processing; you object to the processing and
      there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (for example
      where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you shall
      have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data
      concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent
      that it is related to such direct marketing); the personal data has been
      unlawfully processed; the personal data has to be erased for compliance
      with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which we are the
      subject.
