      <p>3. Who are we?</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1. We are the Platform, developed by a team of volunteers, aiming to
        create the META HISTORY museum, make the marketplace for the sale and
        purchase of NFTs, and raise funds to support Ukraine (financing
        humanitarian aid, cyber defense, and restoration of valuable cultural
        sites affected by the war), creating a cultural project that will
        produce and present new Ukrainian art in the world, spreading the truth
        about the war in Ukraine through the cultural context.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>We divide funds received from the sale of NFTs as follows:</p>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            100% of the first sale and 10% of the second sale of works from the
            first NFT drop of the Warline collection goes to the Ministry of
            Digital Transformation.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            100% of the first sale and 6.5% of the second sale of works from the
            second NFT drop of the Warline collection goes to the Ministry of
            Digital Transformation. 3.5% of the second sale of works goes to the
            artists who created works for the second drop.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            100% of the first sale of the third and fourth NFT drops of the
            Warline collection goes to the Ministry of Digital Transformation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            100% of the first sale of works from the fifth NFT drop of the
            Warline collection goes to the Ministry of Culture and Information
            Policy.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            67% of the first sale of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth NFT
            drops of the Warline collection goes to the Ministry of Culture and
            Information Policy. 33% from the first sale and 10% from the second
            sale of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth NFT drops of the
            Warline collection goes to the META HISTORY museum, which will use
            the funds to support the artists and further support the
            project&apos;s activities, including payment for technical services,
            services, and advertising materials.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            67% of the first sale of the tenth, eleventh, and further NFT drops
            of the Warline collection will go to the United24 Presidential
            Platform. 33% from the first sale and 10% from the second sale of
            the tenth, eleventh, and further NFT drops of the Warline collection
            will go to the META HISTORY museum, which will use the funds to

            activities.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to the policy of dividing the funds received from the sale of
        NFTs are needed to allow the META HISTORY museum to continue its
        activities and work on creating the Warline collection until the end of
        the war, the length of which exceeded our expectations.
